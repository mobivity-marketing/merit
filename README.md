# [Merit Marketing Site](https://getmerit.org)

## About

This repository hold the front end code for Merit's marketing site.

## To Work in This Project:

* If you don't already have Node.js installed, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download it.
* If you don't already have [Grunt](http://www.gruntjs.com) installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt-cli` in the terminal.
* In the terminal, navigate (`cd`) into the project directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `grunt watch` to preview while working (open the relevant `index.html` file for the template you're working with in your browser), and `grunt` to compile all code when you're finished. This will place all minified and translated code/images into the `dist` folder.
* Make any SCSS/JS changes within the `src` directory, and edit pages within the main directory. All files inside of the `dist` directory will be deleted and replaced with each run of `grunt`.

## Built With:

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (Thanks to [Matt Bailey](http://mattbailey.io/a-beginners-guide-to-grunt-redux/) for the Grunt setup template).
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Bootstrap v4](http://getbootstrap.com/)
